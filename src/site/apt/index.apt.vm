  Being fully integrated with Maven it allows to both leverage the vast number of Maven plugins for your Alfresco project as well as integrated your
  project easily in Open Source and Enterprise development processes.

  The Alfresco SDK\x99 is fully documented in the single components websites (see menu above).

How to Use the SDK

  The easiest way to use the SDK is to create a sample project using one of the available <<archetypes>> (Platform JAR, Share JAR or All in One).

  You can also use the Alfresco Maven Plugin directly on any JAR project.
  
SDK Versions 
  
  As of version 2.0, releases for the Alfresco SDK are available in Maven Central.
  
  Maven Alfresco SDK 1.x versions rely on the {{{https://artifacts.alfresco.com/nexus/content/groups/public/}Alfresco Artifacts Repository}}.
  For documentation on the Maven Alfresco SDK\x99 1.x please refer to {{{https://artifacts.alfresco.com/nexus/content/repositories/alfresco-docs/alfresco-lifecycle-aggregator/latest/index.html} Maven Alfresco SDK 1.x}}

Alfresco SDK\x99 components

  The Alfresco SDK relies on a number of components:

  * Archetypes providing sample project to kickstart your Alfresco development and boost it with best practices

      * the {{{./archetypes/alfresco-platform-jar-archetype/index.html}Platform JAR}}, a single project that customizes Alfresco Repository

      * the {{{./archetypes/alfresco-share-jar-archetype/index.html}Share JAR}}, a single project that customizes Alfresco Share

      * the {{{./archetypes/alfresco-allinone-archetype/index.html}All-in-One}}, a multi-module project to customize and run all components

  * The {{{./plugins/alfresco-maven-plugin/index.html} Maven Alfresco Plugin}} to setup, build, test and run your customizations

  * The {{{https://artifacts.alfresco.com}Alfresco Artifacts Repository}} provides backing for this SDK.

Pre-requisites

* System prerequisites

    No manual Alfresco download, application server or database is required. The {{{./plugins/alfresco-maven-plugin/index.html} Maven Alfresco Plugin}} will by default launch an embedded
    H2 Database along with an embedded Tomcat server. Advanced use cases can be configured to use external databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL or various enterprise databases. See the
    {{{./plugins/alfresco-maven-plugin/index.html} Maven Alfresco Plugin}} documentation for more information.

    See details in the {{{./prerequisites.html} SDK pre-requisites page}}.

* Rapid development with HotSwap Agent or JRebel

    The SDK (as of 3.0) support true rapid development and IDE integration. To allow hot reload of Java classes the SDK leverages
    {{{http://hotswapagent.org}HotSwap Agent}}, a library which allows seamless reloading of classfiles. JRebel is also supported out of the box.
    
    Check the {{{./prerequisites.html} SDK pre-requisites page}} to enable rapid development.
